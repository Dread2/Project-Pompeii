****ASROCK B365M IB-R Repair** <br />
LGA Socket Replacement <br />
Code Name: Coffee Lake (Socket 1151)

This repository contains notes and useful images for the project.  
✔️ Kapton Tape has been used to protect Chokes and Resistors  
✔️ Still need to check for electrical shorts from the LGA socket pins.
- Note: Continuity test showed no shorts on all capacitors. VRM caps in parallel registered
  no beep on multimeter along with 24 pin caps + MOSFETs. 
X Considering either Hot Air or pure IR for desoldering. IR has more accuracy but is much slower to heat up. More even heat is better than pure excessive heat to desolder  
X Need to get better flux, but more importantly wick
